# Cornhole Data Analysis
***Analyzing Cornhole Success: Toss Ability &amp; Board Management***

I worked in a group of six people with a goal of choosing an uncommon sport to watch and analyze. After careful consideration, we decided on cornhole because we knew there was enough footage available online, and we were familiar enough with it to provide a detailed analysis.

As you will read more in our final report, we manually tracked over 1,000 observations from a [2021 American Cornhole League World Championship: Pro Singles hosted by DraftKings tournament](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZ6-E4jsgzw). Through this process, we collected our own metrics, such as the result of each toss, whether the toss affected other bags, and whether the toss was blocking a hole. Using these metrics, we were able to create more advanced metrics to help us analyze what factors contribute towards winning and how impactful blocking the hole is.

In this repository, you will find our raw data, our manipulated data sets, our Rmd notebook file, and finally, our final report, which talks about our process and conclusions.
